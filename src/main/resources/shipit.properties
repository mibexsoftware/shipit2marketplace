shipit.task.user= Bamboo user with JIRA access
shipit.task.user.placeholder=Search for a user
shipit.task.user.description=If there is no Bamboo user with the same name as the one you use to trigger a release from JIRA or if you don't want to use the JIRA release panel, provide a Bamboo user with JIRA access here.

shipit.task.deduceBuildNrFromPluginVersion=Deduce add-on build number
shipit.task.deduceBuildNrFromPluginVersion.description=This will deduce the build number for the Atlassian Marketplace from the plug-in version (e.g., plug-in version 1.0.0 will result in the server build number 100000000 and DC build number 100000001, so the DC build number is always +1). You can override this by configuring the Bamboo build variables "shipit2mpac.buildnr" for server and "shipit2mpac.datacenter.buildnr" for DC deployments in the JIRA release or the Bamboo build dialog.
